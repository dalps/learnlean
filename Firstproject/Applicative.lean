/- Let's combine the [Expect ε] monad with the [WithLog logged] monad
  to validate user input. This combination won't be a new monad though,
  rather an applicative functor.

  Much like [Except], [Validate] allows to characterize whether the collected data is valid or not. Unlike [Except] it allows to keep track of _multiple errors_ that may be present in the data, gathered
  in a list in a similar function to [WithLog].

/- A [Subtype] is a [Type] equipped with a predicate over its values.

-/
structure Subtype' {α : Type} (p : α → Prop) where
  val : α
  property : p val

/- Lean has special notation - reminiscent of Coq's - for subtypes.

  For example, one can define a subtype of [Nat] that rules
  out zero. We already did encoded positive numbers with [PosNat], but the advantage of this method is in the special treatment of the [Nat] and [Int] types. Lean implements these primitive types with heavy optimizations, something that user-defined inductive types don't get to enjoy.

  Thus, [FastPos] is faster than [PosNat].
-/
def FastPos : Type := {x : Nat // x > 0}

/- In order to build a [FastPos], you need to supply a structure containing a [Nat] and evidence that it is less than zero.

/- Let's implement the business logic of the validator.
  The [CheckedInput] characterizes sanitized data. It is parameterized on the year that validation is performed, and it relies on subtypes.

  The individual checks to be performed are conjucts in the subtypes' properties.

  The contraints are:
  * The name may not be empty
  * The birth year must be numeric and non-negative
  * The birth year must be greater than 1900 and less than or equal to the year in which validation is performed

  1.

  Assume [u = some g], [v = some f], [w = some x], for any
  functions [f] and [g] and any value [x].

  We reduce both sides separately and show that they reduce
  to the same value.

  some f <*> some x
  ===>
  f <$> some x

  some (f x)

  4.
  u <*> some y = some (· y) <*> u

  If [u = none], both sides reduce to [none]:

  none <*> some y ===> none
  some (· y) <*> none ===> (· y) <$> none ===> none

  If [u = some f] for any [f], then both sides reduce to [some (f y)]:

  some f <*> some y ===> f <$> some y ===> some (f y)

  some (· y) <*> some f ===> (· y) <$> some f

    Recall the association law of the monad contract:

    x >>= f >>= g  =  x >>= (fun y => f y >>= g)

    Which can also be writted without parentheses:

    x >>= f >>= g  =  x >>= fun y => f y >>= g

    It basically allows you to "slice" the body of
    an abstraction until [g] the next [>>=] and use
    it as the second operator of the first [>>=].

    Another way to digest it: it doesn't matter
    whether you first reduce [f >>= g] in a context
    where [x] is taken abstract or you first reduce [x],
    use it to compute [f] and then [g], the result is the same.

-- # Alternatives

abbrev NonEmptyString := {s : String // s ≠ ""}

/- There are two alternative validations paths now:

   a correct validator should address all variants.

   This is equivalent to defining multiple [CheckedInput]
   structures to characterize distinct sets of valid input.

    validator would have failed or produced another one. -/

deriving Repr

/- The new validator is able to recover from failures and move on
   to the remaining cases, while preserving error messages.

   To this purpose we introduce the [orElse] operator.

   Notice the difference with [andThen]'s signature:
   1. The lazy parameter: no need to look into other cases
     (and therefore spend resources) if the current case succeeds.
   2. Both cases have the same result type.
   3. Branching rather than sequencing.

  | .errors aErrs =>
    match b () with
    | .ok b => .ok b -- Recover from failure
    | .errors bErrs => .errors (aErrs ++ bErrs) -- Preserve errors

/-
  Lean supports this pattern with two dedicated type classes.

  The homogenous [OrElse] allows to recover from the failures
  in the first argument by evaluating the second one, which must
  have the same type.

  class OrElse (α : Type) where
    orElse : α → (Unit → α) → α

  [OrElse.orElse] is bound to the infix operator [<|>], too.
-/
instance : OrElse (Validate ε α) where
  orElse := Validate.orElse

/-
  To build a global validator for [LegacyCheckedInput], we build
  validators for each constructor and combine then with [<|>].

  The local checks of the constructor are sequenced with [<*>]
  as we saw before.

  The [company] constructor is peculiar in that it is implied by anonymous evidence that the name field of the form matches "FIRM".
  The evidence can be anonymous because it won't be recorded: this
  is implemented with a throwaway [Unit] and a function that
  ignores its argument.
